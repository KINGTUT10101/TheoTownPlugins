A repo containing most of the TheoTown plugins I've worked on. If a plugin isn't included here, it may contain assets that I cannot release under the current license.

Some plugins may not work without a privileged code. You will need to provide this code yourself and manually edit the necessary files. Unfortunately, I cannot provide this code to you without it being revoked by the TheoTown admins.

Unless otherwise stated, the license applies to anything you can find in this repo. All I ask is that you credit me (Kingtut 101), this GitHub page, or my YouTube channel.
